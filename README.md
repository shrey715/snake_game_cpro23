# Snake Game

In this project, you'll get some practice with C coding by creating a playable snake game. If you're not familiar with snake, [you can try out a demo at this link](https://www.xarg.org/project/html5-snake/). Please follow directions bellow:

1. Log in to GitHub in VS Code by clicking the user icon in the bottom left corner (above gearbox). In the VSCode terminal, clone the repo to your local machine using the repo URL obtained while accepting the assignment.  
```sh
     git clone <your-repo-url>
```
     
2. Attempt the tasks mentioned in [https://cs61c.org/fa23/projects/proj1/#conceptual-overview](https://cs61c.org/fa23/projects/proj1/#conceptual-overview) and make changes to only `src/snake.c`, `src/state.c`, and `src/custom_tests.c`.
   
3. Run the following commands locally to see how your code is doing.
```sh
   make run-unit-tests 
   make run-unit-tests-<1 to 6 except 2>  
   make run-integration-tests
```

4. commit your changes to the GitHub repo by running
  ```sh
   git add -A
   git commit -m "<commit message>"
   git push origin main
  ```
    
5. For seeing the logs/cmd line output of auto-grading:   
   Go to your repo URL > open the actions tab > click latest workflow run > autograding

## Evaluation

We will have an intermediate evaluation on 10th November and a final evaluation on or after Nov 30th. We will announce the details of this by Monday (but roughly you will need to do finish upto Task 4). You should do regular commits to the repositories. Each task has to be part of separate commits. We make add a couple of additional tasks later.

## Honor Code
You shall not collaborate in this project evaluation. Any instance of copying or in case you are unable to explain your code shall result in getting -5% marks (ie -5% marks will be added to your course total). If you havent completed
the intermediate evals on 10th Nov, it shall result in -1% marks.

## Using Git

We just need very basic knowledge of git. You may go over the links below.

- [Git Videos](https://git-scm.com/videos)
- [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/): You can go over chapters 1,2,3 (mostly we will only need 2).
- [Github for beginners in 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwj89i2FmG0)

## Using Make

You will not need much knowledge of make for the project, since the makefile is already given to you. You will
not be required to change it unless you are doing something very advanced. The following reference is provided to help you understand how it works. Knowing it would be helpful in the future.
